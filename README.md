# flowSolve

So far:
-takes in all the board files
-passes the String array to a method that converts to Node array
	(Node array is the board that is edited, not String array)
-assigns each node with some information that will be needed
-dummy methods for smartSolve and dumbSolve
-printBoard method --> prints the Node array board, not String array
